SCTP Conformance Test Suite
===========================

The Conformance Test Suite for Linux Kernel Stream Control Transmission
Protocol Project is a packet level test suite. The primary goal of this
project is to check whether the implementation of the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol in the Linux kernel is based on the features and
functions defined in the following documents:

  * [Stream Control Transmission Protocol (IETF RFC2960)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2960.txt)
  * [SCTP Specification Errata and Issues (IETF RFC4460)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4460.txt)
  * [Stream Control Transmission Protocol (IETF RFC4960)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4960.txt)
  * [SCTP Authentication Chunk (IETF RFC4895)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4895.txt)
  * [SCTP Dynamic Address Reconfiguration (IETF RFC5061)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5061.txt)

In addition to the ongoing development effort, this project also aims to
test the future RFC features.
