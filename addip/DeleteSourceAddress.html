  1. Send ASCONF chunk from endpoint A to B with delete delete an IP

  2. Check A: ASCONF-ACK with delete source IP address error should be

  5.3.  General Rules for Address Manipulation</pre>
<pre>
    When building TLV parameters for the ASCONF Chunk that will add or
    delete IP addresses, the following rules MUST be applied:</pre>
<PRE>
    <B>F8)  If a request is received to delete an IP address that is also
         the source address of the IP packet that contained the ASCONF
         chunk, the receiver MUST reject this request.  To reject the
         request, the receiver MUST send an Error Cause TLV set to the
         new error code 'Request to Delete Source IP Address' (unless
         Rule F5 has also been violated, in which case the error code
         'Request to Delete Last Remaining IP Address' is sent).</B>
