  TEST DESCRIPTION:</pre>
<pre>
  1. From endpoint B, send valid DATA message 6 times to endpoint A when
     there is association between them. Only the first 4 DATA messages
     will be sent to endpoint A due to the Congestion control window.
  2. From endpoint A, receive DATA message 4 times. Send SACK of the first
     3 DATA message to endpoint B with zero advertised window.
  3. Check A: DATA 5 will not be sent to endpoint A and DATA 4 will be
     sent again after expiry of T3-rtx timer.
  4. From endpoint A, send SACK of the DATA 4 to endpoint B with zero
     advertised window.
  5. Check B: DATA 5 will be sent to endpoint A as a zero window probe.
  6. From endpoint A, send SACK of the DATA 5 to endpoint B with zero
     advertised window.
  7. Check B: DATA 6 will be sent to endpoint A as a zero window probe.
  8. From endpoint A, send SACK of the DATA 6 to endpoint B with zero
     advertised window.</pre>

  RFC 4960</pre>
<pre>
  6.1.  Transmission of DATA Chunks</pre>
<pre>
    A) At any given time, the data sender MUST NOT transmit new data to
       any destination transport address if its peer's rwnd indicates
       that the peer has no buffer space (i.e., rwnd is 0; see Section
       6.2.1).  However, regardless of the value of rwnd (including if it
       is 0), the data sender can always have one DATA chunk in flight to
       the receiver if allowed by cwnd (see rule B, below).  This rule
       allows the sender to probe for a change in rwnd that the sender
       missed due to the SACK's having been lost in transit from the data
       receiver to the data sender.</pre>
<PRE>
       <B>When the receiver's advertised window is zero, this probe is
       called a zero window probe.  Note that a zero window probe SHOULD
       only be sent when all outstanding DATA chunks have been
       cumulatively acknowledged and no DATA chunks are in flight.  Zero
       window probing MUST be supported.</B>
</PRE><pre>
       If the sender continues to receive new packets from the receiver
       while doing zero window probing, the unacknowledged window probes
       should not increment the error counter for the association or any
       destination transport address.  This is because the receiver MAY
       keep its window closed for an indefinite time.  Refer to Section
       6.2 on the receiver behavior when it advertises a zero window.
       The sender SHOULD send the first zero window probe after 1 RTO
       when it detects that the receiver has closed its window and SHOULD
       increase the probe interval exponentially afterwards.  Also note
       that the cwnd SHOULD be adjusted according to Section 7.2.1.  Zero
       window probing does not affect the calculation of cwnd.</pre>
<pre>
       The sender MUST also have an algorithm for sending new DATA chunks
       to avoid silly window syndrome (SWS) as described in [RFC0813].
       The algorithm can be similar to the one described in Section
       4.2.3.4 of [RFC1122].</pre>
<pre>
       However, regardless of the value of rwnd (including if it is 0),
       the data sender can always have one DATA chunk in flight to the
       receiver if allowed by cwnd (see rule B below).  This rule allows
       the sender to probe for a change in rwnd that the sender missed
       due to the SACK having been lost in transit from the data receiver
       to the data sender.</pre>
