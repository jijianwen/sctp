  To check that if FORWARD-TSN Chunk is received with New Cumulative TSN

  TEST DESCRIPTION:</pre>
<pre>
  1. Send FORWARD-TSN chunk from endpoint A to B with New Cumulative
     TSN at the current cumulative TSN point.
  2. Check A: SACK chunk should be received at endpoint A with current
     cumulative TSN. And endpoint B should treat this FORWARD-TSN as
     out-of-date and NOT update its Cumulative TSN.
  3. Send FORWARD-TSN chunk from endpoint A to B with New Cumulative
     TSN behind the current cumulative TSN point.
  4. Check B: SACK chunk should be received at endpoint A with current
     cumulative TSN. And endpoint B should treat this FORWARD-TSN as
     out-of-date and NOT update its Cumulative TSN.</pre>

<pre>
  RFC 3758</pre>
<pre>
  3.6.  Receiver Side Implementation of PR-SCTP</pre>
<pre>
    After the above processing, the data receiver MUST stop reporting any
    missing TSNs earlier than or equal to the new cumulative TSN point.</pre>
<PRE>
    <B>Note, if the "New Cumulative TSN" value carried in the arrived
    FORWARD TSN chunk is found to be behind or at the current cumulative
    TSN point, the data receiver MUST treat this FORWARD TSN as out-of-
    date and MUST NOT update its Cumulative TSN.</B>  The receiver SHOULD
    send a SACK to its peer (the sender of the FORWARD TSN) since such a
    duplicate may indicate the previous SACK was lost in the network.
</PRE><pre>
    Any time a FORWARD TSN chunk arrives, for the purposes of sending a
    SACK, the receiver MUST follow the same rules as if a DATA chunk had
    been received (i.e., follow the delayed sack rules specified in RFC
    2960 [2] section 6.2).</pre>
