  TEST DESCRIPTION:</pre>
<pre>
  1. From an endpoint in established state, do not send any message to 
     another endpoint within the current Heartbeat period. HEARTBEAT
     message is sent to its peer. Record the message sequence using
     a signal emulator.
  2. Check A: If HEARTBEAT message is transmitted for ASSOCIATION.MAX.RETRANS 
     times without getting an HEARTBEAT-ACK, Association is aborted and 
     upper layers are reported of this.</pre>

  RFC 4960</pre>
<pre>
  8.3.  Path Heartbeat</pre>
<pre>
    By default, an SCTP endpoint SHOULD monitor the reachability of the
    idle destination transport address(es) of its peer by sending a
    HEARTBEAT chunk periodically to the destination transport
    address(es).  HEARTBEAT sending MAY begin upon reaching the
    ESTABLISHED state and is discontinued after sending either SHUTDOWN
    or SHUTDOWN-ACK.  A receiver of a HEARTBEAT MUST respond to a
    HEARTBEAT with a HEARTBEAT-ACK after entering the COOKIE-ECHOED state
    (INIT sender) or the ESTABLISHED state (INIT receiver), up until
    reaching the SHUTDOWN-SENT state (SHUTDOWN sender) or the SHUTDOWN-
    ACK-SENT state (SHUTDOWN receiver).</pre>
<pre>
    A destination transport address is considered &quot;idle&quot; if no new chunk
    that can be used for updating path RTT (usually including first
    transmission DATA, INIT, COOKIE ECHO, HEARTBEAT, etc.) and no
    HEARTBEAT has been sent to it within the current heartbeat period of
    that address.  This applies to both active and inactive destination
    addresses.</pre>
<pre>
    The upper layer can optionally initiate the following functions:</pre>
<pre>
    A) Disable heartbeat on a specific destination transport address of a
       given association,</pre>
<pre>
    B) Change the HB.interval,</pre>
<pre>
    C) Re-enable heartbeat on a specific destination transport address of
       a given association, and</pre>
<pre>
    D) Request an on-demand HEARTBEAT on a specific destination transport
       address of a given association.</pre>
<pre>
    The endpoint should increment the respective error counter of the
    destination transport address each time a HEARTBEAT is sent to that
    address and not acknowledged within one RTO.</pre>
<pre>
    When the value of this counter reaches the protocol parameter
    'Path.Max.Retrans', the endpoint should mark the corresponding
    destination address as inactive if it is not so marked, and may also
    optionally report to the upper layer the change of reachability of
    this destination address.  After this, the endpoint should continue
    HEARTBEAT on this destination address but should stop increasing the
    counter.</pre>
<pre>
    The sender of the HEARTBEAT chunk should include in the Heartbeat
    Information field of the chunk the current time when the packet is
    sent out and the destination address to which the packet is sent.</pre>
<pre>
    IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: An alternative implementation of the heartbeat
    mechanism that can be used is to increment the error counter variable
    every time a HEARTBEAT is sent to a destination.  Whenever a
    HEARTBEAT ACK arrives, the sender SHOULD clear the error counter of
    the destination that the HEARTBEAT was sent to.  This in effect would
    clear the previously stroked error (and any other error counts as
    well).</pre>
<pre>
    The receiver of the HEARTBEAT should immediately respond with a
    HEARTBEAT ACK that contains the Heartbeat Information TLV, together
    with any other received TLVs, copied unchanged from the received
    HEARTBEAT chunk.</pre>
<pre>
    Upon the receipt of the HEARTBEAT ACK, the sender of the HEARTBEAT
    should clear the error counter of the destination transport address
    to which the HEARTBEAT was sent, and mark the destination transport
    address as active if it is not so marked.  The endpoint may
    optionally report to the upper layer when an inactive destination
    address is marked as active due to the reception of the latest
    HEARTBEAT ACK.  The receiver of the HEARTBEAT ACK must also clear the
    association overall error count as well (as defined in Section 8.1).</pre>
<pre>
    The receiver of the HEARTBEAT ACK should also perform an RTT
    measurement for that destination transport address using the time
    value carried in the HEARTBEAT ACK chunk.</pre>
<pre>
    On an idle destination address that is allowed to heartbeat, it is
    recommended that a HEARTBEAT chunk is sent once per RTO of that
    destination address plus the protocol parameter 'HB.interval', with
    jittering of +/- 50% of the RTO value, and exponential backoff of the
    RTO if the previous HEARTBEAT is unanswered.</pre>
<pre>
    A primitive is provided for the SCTP user to change the HB.interval
    and turn on or off the heartbeat on a given destination address.  The
    heartbeat interval set by the SCTP user is added to the RTO of that
    destination (including any exponential backoff).  Only one heartbeat
    should be sent each time the heartbeat timer expires (if multiple
    destinations are idle).  It is an implementation decision on how to
    choose which of the candidate idle destinations to heartbeat to (if
    more than one destination is idle).</pre>
<pre>
    Note: When tuning the heartbeat interval, there is a side effect that
    SHOULD be taken into account.  When this value is increased, i.e.,
    the HEARTBEAT takes longer, the detection of lost ABORT messages
    takes longer as well.  If a peer endpoint ABORTs the association for
    any reason and the ABORT chunk is lost, the local endpoint will only
    discover the lost ABORT by sending a DATA chunk or HEARTBEAT chunk
    (thus causing the peer to send another ABORT).  This must be
    considered when tuning the HEARTBEAT timer.  If the HEARTBEAT is
    disabled, only sending DATA to the association will discover a lost
    ABORT from the peer.</pre>
